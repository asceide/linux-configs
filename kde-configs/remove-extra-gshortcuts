We are going to be using Application menu as an example, with three short cuts 96, 136 and 149

1)First find the repeating entries by using 
    cat ~/.config/kglobalshortcutsrc | grep 'Activate Application Launcher'
    
    There should be some entries that pop up like
    activate widget 96=......
    activate widget 136=.....
    activate widget 149=...
    
2) Take note of those widget numbers and then edit the ~/.config/plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc and delete any extra entries for applets. For example
    [Containments][148][96]
        .....
    [Containments][148][136]
        .....
    [Containments][148][149]
        .....
        
3)Afterwards, delete the entries that correspond to the extra applets from plasma-org.kde.plasma.desktop-appletsrc.

4)Lastly, you must run this command otherwise the shortcut entries will be once again be added back after your next logout/restart
    kquitapp5 kglobalaccel && sleep 2s && kglobalaccel5&
    
That should do it.
