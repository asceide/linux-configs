1) cd to Downloads
2) Open terminal and execute 
    curl --location "https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-devedition-latest-ssl&os=linux64&lang=en-US" \ | tar --extract --verbose --preserve-permissions --bzip2
3) Move the firefox directory to /opt with
    sudo mv firefox /opt
4) Add the path to your bash/zsh/etc profile. In my case using zsh
    vim ~/.zshrc
    export PATH=/opt/firefox/firefox:$PATH
5) Copy the .desktop fire to /usr/share/applications

##TO DO##
See what to do if you want to keep multiple versions of Firefox (since the executable is firefox in this case)
