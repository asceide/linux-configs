Solus Configurations
==========================
*Just a list of Solus specific configurations and tips

-------------
Installation
-------------

**DO NOT** and I repeat **DO NOT** do anything after initial installation other than updating the system. All the packages from the iso snapshot are severely out of date and will break your system if you do something like install nvidia's drivers.


Visual Studio Code
===================

It's probably better to install VSC from the snap store than the packages from the distribution. I was having trouble adding it to PATH.
